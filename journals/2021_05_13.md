### v1 #capture #[[insta content]]
#### I initially started with "apple/samsung vs the smartphone marketplace"
#### Than I realized it's not what my audience needs
#### Health and smartphones?
#### Instead I thoughts what would a fitness couch want? or a Eco product brand be interested in?
#### An eco product?
#### Every ecommerce has trouble being authantic.
#### Personal brands blow them away in engagement and growth.
#### What to do?
#### Use a representative!
#### That's how my posts was made
## Backlinks in sketch note
### Idea #capture #[[app idea]]
#### sync tagged images to the tag within the zettl app
#### all sketches are shown within the tag pages
#### How?
##### v1 - on the side but sidebar
##### v2 - mixed with notes
### I can capture notes but what about sketches?
### I want to have a way to have the backlink power in my sketching app
### The ability to organise notes with backlinks and tags is powerful
### My workflow
#### note
##### just capture ideas in daily journal
##### than see all the results in the capture tag with filtering
##### insta content, app ideas, etc
#### images
##### just tagging them seems to work...
##### Just tag with the type - insta, Yt, etc
##### than add the post name to remmember by
##### every sketch will be used for that only
##### Now I feel silly
